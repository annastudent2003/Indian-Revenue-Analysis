# Indian Revenue Analysis - Trade & Tourism
Made a interactive dashboard using Advanced Excel. And filtered, cleaned and combined the datasets using MySQL.

# Problem Statement

India’s economy is significantly influenced by both its tourism sector and its international trade activities. While tourism generates direct revenue through domestic and foreign visitors, exports and imports shape the country’s trade balance and overall economic growth. However, decision-makers often lack an integrated view of how these two sectors perform relative to each other over time.

This project aims to analyze and compare yearly trends in tourism revenue, exports, and imports for India, identify patterns, highlight growth opportunities, and present the findings through an interactive Excel dashboard. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that can help policymakers and businesses understand the relationship between tourism performance and trade outcomes, and make informed strategic decisions.
